    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of
      ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The
      patty may be pan-fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are
      often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or
      chilis; condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, or
      "special sauce", and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A
      hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.
