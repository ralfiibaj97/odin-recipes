    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until softened.</li>
      <li>Add ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and optional fresh herbs. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a portion of grated Parmesan cheese. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer with lasagna noodles, followed by more meat sauce, a layer of the ricotta mixture, and a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving to allow it to set.</li>
