# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe site for The Odin Project’s Foundations course. I’ll build a homepage that links to a handful of recipe pages using basic HTML (headings, lists, links, images) and clean, semantic structure.

**Skills demonstrated**
- Git & GitHub (SSH) and command-line workflow  
- Small, meaningful commits with clear messages  
- HTML structure, lists, links, images, and relative paths  
- Organizing a tiny project with folders 

## Reflection 
- What I found easy/hard:
- What I learned about Git:
- What I’d improve next time:
